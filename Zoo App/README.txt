Online Zoo Info System/ Protype Model

1. SpringBoot 2  Back-End Tool
2. Angular 8   Front-END tool
3. MySql       RDBMS/JPA

REST API IMPLEMENTATION

Here as per for implementation I have considered Zoo's Anmal Class
Attribute
     
    id 
    aname
    atype
    aspecies
    parea
    count

Here my main abstraction is that "id" of animal will
care manipulation of data and uniqueness

AnimalType here will for representing Reptile, Bird, Mammal

Species will care particular species when types are same as per 

parea, is Pen Area for animals like P2A2 represent pen/2 of area/2
    
Here other model class should be Admin.. for management purposes

Overall, project will be best implemented as per requirement soon...

Here CORS feature has been implemented to integrate Front-End/Back-End
